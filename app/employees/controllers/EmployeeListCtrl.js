// employee factory is being injected. Factories in Angular are not bound to one controller/partial and can be used to do data operations. Controllers will do the same data operations over again. The factory becomes a common utility to be used. Any controller can access the factory.
angular
.module("EmployeeApp")
// name of factory gets injects as a parameter to be used in the controller - can add as many parameters as needed -- ($scope, EmployeeFactory, anotherParameter, ETC) and order doesn't matter where they are called in the parameter. Function arguments are dependencies.
.controller("EmployeeListCtrl", function ($scope, EmployeeFactory) {
    $scope.employees = []

    // renders list of employees
    EmployeeFactory.list().then(data => {
        $scope.employees = data
    })
})
